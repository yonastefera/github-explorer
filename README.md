# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Before you run any script you need to install packages by `yarn install`
## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## Dev notes

You need to put your GITHub access token to .env file with `REACT_APP_GITHUB_TOKEN` name.

I used `material ui` as components library and `Apollo` as graphql client

### Future Improvements

1) Typescript support
2) Jest tests
